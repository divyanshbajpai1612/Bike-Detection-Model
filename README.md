# Bike-Detection-Model
Welcome to the Bike Detection ML Model repository! This project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) for detecting bikes in images. The model is trained to identify bikes in various environments, making it useful for applications such as traffic monitoring, bike sharing systems, and urban planning.
